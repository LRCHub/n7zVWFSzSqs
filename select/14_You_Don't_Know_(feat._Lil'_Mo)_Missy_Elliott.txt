You Don't Know

Now see, the one thing I like about the niggas
Is that they can fess up to one of they boys
That they been sleepin' wit' the same chick, and laugh about it
But see, a woman, could never admit to another woman
That she been sleepin' wit' her man
Cuz if that ever happened to me
I would call your house and be like, yo

Don't you gotta man
Why you fuckin' wit' mine
See, I been through bad times
Get yo' mind off mines
You must be lonely
Why you messin' wit' me
But it won't be easy
To get my baby

1 - You don't know who you messin' with
Most of them leave with they car doors bent
I'm so pissed, you gon' make me flip
I'mma teach you not to touch my shit

Above While:
Hello?
Hello?
Who dis?
It's Mo'
For Real?
Hello?

I be callin' his house, when you're not around
Don't make me warn you, you know how I get down, down
Somebody told me, but I ain't trippin' off you, no
If you were doing your thang, he'd still be wit' you

Repeat 1 while:
Hello?
You know who this is bitch, heh, yeah
Yo, who dis for real, man, hello?
You know who it is

2 - I can't believe you would ever do that
Can't you show me some respect
Is it cuz you jus' a reject
Gotta keep your ass in check

Repeat above While:
Hello?
Hello?

Yo, this ain't no game

When I hadda come through there last year, what
And I'd do it again, cuz I want, I, I got comin'
You ain't keepin nutin' in check
And keep him from around my house, bitch
Please, I'mma beat that ass, you know I will

You don't know who you messin' with
Most of them leave with their car doors bent
Blow out you like I'mma air vent
